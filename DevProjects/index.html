        <hr />

        <p class="p-justify">
          As an enthusiastic Codecademy Pro member, I've been actively immersing
          myself in their diverse course offerings since July 7, 2023. Over this
          period, I've successfully completed courses in HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript, and I'm currently honing my skills in React. In addition
          to my Codecademy curriculum, I dedicate an extra hour daily to explore
          further programming resources such as freeCodeCamp, w3schools, and edX
          or HarvardX (CS50's). These platforms offer a wealth of free
          resources, serving as invaluable aids, particularly for individuals
          eager to delve into the world of programming.
        </p>

        <p class="p-justify">
          While I haven't yet gained professional experience as a web developer
          in a company setting, my journey has involved creating several
          projects through online learning platforms like Codecademy. These
          projects, backed by certificates demonstrating my grasp of fundamental
          programming concepts and website development, reflect my commitment to
          mastering the essentials. I am confident in translating this
          foundational knowledge into practical applications for your company's
          projects, driven by my strong work ethic, determination, and a solid
          understanding of the basics.
